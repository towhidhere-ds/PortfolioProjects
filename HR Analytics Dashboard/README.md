# **HR Analytics Dashboard**

## **About This Project**

This project is built to help HR teams understand their workforce through data. The dashboard highlights employee demographics, attrition patterns, satisfaction scores, and department-level trends. It is a practical portfolio piece demonstrating dashboard building, data transformation, analytics thinking, and storytelling through visual insights.

The dashboard answers questions such as:

* How many employees are currently active?
* Which departments are losing the most talent?
* Does attrition differ by gender or age group?
* What is the overall job satisfaction score across teams?

This solution gives HR leaders a way to make decisions using clear, visual insights instead of guessing.

## **Business Problem**

Most HR departments struggle because their employee data is scattered or not analyzed. Decisions are made based on assumptions instead of data. Without a clear set of metrics, it is difficult to measure turnover, understand what drives attrition, or plan hiring needs.

This dashboard solves those challenges by:

* Creating standard HR KPIs
* Visualizing workforce behavior
* Making employee trends easy to understand
* Supporting HR strategy with evidence

A detailed Business Problem Statement is included in the repository as a PDF.
